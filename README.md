## A look at collision theory connectivity in three dimensional Neural Networks

Please read through v.docx for more information on what has been acheived thus far.

The code takes a look at how to make use of the hashmapping functionality and three dimesnional proximities
to connect neurons together successfully and output their locations.

At present an attempt at implementing an AI has been made unsccessfully. However, for now the project is on hold
to look into another project surrounding geometrics.

## The purpose

The purpose of the project was to create a three dimensional Neural Net which makes use of a different algorithm
without making use of MST such as Dijkstra, Kruskal or Primm in their connectivity and communications.

## Currently

Currently, the connectivity between Neurons has ben accomplished, there have been clusters, links and linked clusters 
observed on randomisation of Neuron placement during data collection.

There are dat collections to take place and graphical representations to make ready for analysis.

The present code has had the AI stripped out though the variables are still present as are the classes.
